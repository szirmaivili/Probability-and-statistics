# Probability-and-statistics

This library is self-developed to serve the purpose of practice and to have custom functions for statistical tests, 
as well as specific objects for notable distributions. It is written in Python 3.10.12 and requires 
other libraries listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. However, the very beggining of the code is the importation
of the required libraries. 
It mainly contains classes of general and specific probability distributions (exponential, geometric, normal etc.) 
which can be instantiated with ease. The program can calculate their expectation and variance and is able to do
operations between random variables (addition, subtraction, multiply and divide by a constant). 
It also contains implemented statistical tests like one and two-sample u- and t-test and F-test. 

This text above is a brief summary of the code. You can also read the whole documentation with detailed descriptions 
in 'Documentation.pdf'.
